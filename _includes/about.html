  <h1> About </h1>
  <p> I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist studying how humans form new memories and how memories can influence decision-making.
    My research examines how changes in cognitive, motivational, and physiological state alter ongoing brain dynamics, and thus influence the ways in which we search for, process, and encode new information.
    Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate working with Dr. Alison Adcock at Duke University.
